/*This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle.
The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15
This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one has three dots,
the third one has 6 dots and so on.

Write a function that gives the number of dots for its corresponding
triangle number of the sequence.

Examples:
input=1
output=1

input=6
output=21

input=215
output=23220
