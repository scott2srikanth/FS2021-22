/* Write a java program with the following scenario
Given an array of integers, return the largest gap between the sorted elements of the array.

For example, consider the array:

[9, 4, 26, 26, 0, 0, 5, 20, 6, 25, 5]
... in which, after sorting, the array becomes:

[0, 0, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9, 20, 25, 26, 26]
... so that we now see that the largest gap in the array is between 9 and 20 which is 11.

Examples
11              //array size
9  4 26 26 0 0 5 20 6 25 5     // array elements
11              //output

*/
/*

9 4 26 26 0 0 5 20 6 25 5
output=11

case=2
